	the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta's$ recent primary election produced ```` no evidence '''' that any irregularities took place ..


	the jury further said in term presentments that the city executive committee ,, which had over charge of the election ,, ```` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta '''' for the manner in which the election was conducted ..


	the september term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible ```` irregularities '''' in the hard primary which was won by mayor ivan allen jr. ..


	```` only a relative handful of such reports was received '''' ,, the jury said ,, ```` considering the widespread interest in the election ,, the number of voters and the size of this city '''' ..


	the jury said it did find that many of georgia's$ registration and election laws ```` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '''' ..


	it recommended that fulton legislators act ```` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '''' ..


	the grand jury commented on a number of other topics ,, among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said ```` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '''' ..



merger proposed 
however ,, the jury said it believes ```` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '''' ..


	the city purchasing department ,, the jury said ,, ```` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '''' ..
it urged that the city ```` take steps to remedy '''' this problem ..


	implementation of georgia's$ automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury ..


	it urged that the next legislature ```` provide enabling funds and re the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '''' ..


	the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department's$ handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes ..


	```` this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program '''' ,, the jury said ,, but the state welfare department ```` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county ,, which receives none of this money ..


	the jurors said they realize ```` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our$ less populous counties '''' ..


	nevertheless ,, ```` we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds '''' ,, the jurors said ..
```` failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '''' on fulton taxpayers ..


	the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary's$ court which has been under fire for its$ practices in the appointment of appraisers ,, guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation ..



wards protected 
the jury said it found the court ```` has incorporated into its$ operating procedures the recommendations '''' of two previous grand juries ,, the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee ..


	```` these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's$ wards from undue costs and its$ appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '''' ,, the jury said ..


	regarding atlanta's$ new multi airport ,, the jury recommended ```` that when the new management takes charge jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '''' ..


	the jury did not* elaborate ,, but it added that ```` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '''' ..



ask jail deputies 
on other matters ,, the jury recommended that :: (( 1 )) 
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and ```` a doctor ,, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '''' ..
(( 2 )) 
fulton legislators ```` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '''' pension plan for city employes ..


	the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department ,, the fulton tax commissioner's$ office ,, the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms ,, grady hospital and the fulton health department ..

	the hartsfield home is at 637 e. pelham rd. aj ..

	georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's$ race ,, a top official said wednesday ..


	robert snodgrass ,, state gop chairman ,, said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience ..


	state party chairman james w. dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept. 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen. john tower will be the featured speaker ..


	in the blue ridge meeting ,, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters ..


	despite the warning ,, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate ,, according to republicans who attended ..


	when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race ,, it voted no  and there were no dissents ..


	the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race ,, one of two alternative courses must be taken :: 1 
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot ,, or 2 
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system  a system which the party opposes in its$ platform ..

	gov. vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment ..
vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his$ first priority item ..



construction bonds 
meanwhile ,, it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds ..


	the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act ,, and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia's$ most heavily traveled highways ..


	a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work ..



a revolving fund 
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities ..


	vandiver opened his$ race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov. marvin griffin ..


	the highway department source told the constitution ,, however ,, that vandiver has not* been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds ..

	while emphasizing that technical details were not* fully worked out ,, pelham said his$ resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 8731 ..


	a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 295 ..
as of sunday night ,, there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action ..


	pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions ..

	barber ,, who is in his$ 13th year as a legislator ,, said there ```` are some members of our$ congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it (( the resolution )) passed '''' ..
but he added that none of georgia's$ congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution ..


	the resolution ,, which barber tossed into the house hopper friday ,, will be formally read monday ..
it says that ```` in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds '''' ,, the state board of education should be directed to ```` give priority '''' to teacher pay raises ..
