in private life ,, miss garson is mrs. e. e. fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from dallas ,, where they maintain an apartment ,, to their$ california home in los angeles'$ suburban bel to their$ ranch in pecos ,, new mexico ..
therefore ,, her$ wardrobe is largely mobile ,, to be packed at a moment's$ notice and to shake out without a wrinkle ..


	her$ creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't* want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants ```` all of her$ pictures by one painter '''' ..

she likes his$ classic chemise ..
her$ favorite cocktail dress is a norell ,, a black and white organdy and silk jersey ..

it was during ```` old music '''' at the st. james theater that hollywood's$ louis b. mayer spotted her ..

the pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long  but he dutifully kept his$ eye on the gravy ..


	last october he gave a public speech in washington ,, d.c. entitled ```` are women here to stay '''' ?. ?.
so you can see that gerald g. ramsey ,, director of smu's food services ,, is not* the ordinary type of craven ,, women chef ..
he is apt to rear back and claim his$ rights ..




ramsey ,, as smu's food wrangler ,, buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week ..
tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's$ burden !. !.


	he also dishes up 3,000 snacks ..
and he operates three cafeterias in the student center ,, along with mcelvaney dining hall and the athlete's$ tables ..


	ramsey ,, 63 ,, 195 and ruggedly slim ,, says ,, ```` i can't* remember when i didn't* pester my$ mother to teach me to cook '''' ..




he was in charge of the hockaday school meals from 1946 to 1950 ,, before he moved to aj ..
and you'll+md notice that in both places ,, there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line ..


	what does he feed his$ smu football mastodons at the training table ?. ?.


	```` mostly meat and potatoes  they have to have that go without getting too fat '''' ,, says ramsey ..
so he hides the mayonnaise ..
and to keep athletes'$ stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress ,, he bans all highly flavored condiments ..




what do the pretty smu girls like on their$ plates ?. ?.


	```` pretty much hamburger ,, hotdogs ,, steak and ,, at night ,, maybe pizza '''' ,, says the handsome food expert ..
```` unfortunately ,, there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '''' ..


	ramsey has stoked up harry truman ,, henry cabot lodge ,, the king of morocco ,, clement atlee and other shiny characters ..
once four tibetan monks ,, in their$ saffron robes ,, filed through the cafeteria line ..


	```` they aren't* supposed to look at women ,, you know '''' ,, ramsey recalled ..
```` what with all those pretty girls around ,, they had a hard time '''' ..

	contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straight modern but has sculptured pattern ,, many design facets ,, warmth ,, dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability ..


	that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month ..


	though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's ,, two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated ,, but warm look in contemporary ..
these two ,, heritage and drexel ,, chose too not* to produce the exactly matching design for every piece ,, but a collection of correlated designs ,, each of which could stand alone ..


	the heritage collection ,, to be shown by sanger and anderson's$ studio ,, has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time ..
called perennian ,, to indicate its$ lasting ,, good today and tomorrow quality ,, the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces ..


	walnut ,, wormy chestnut ,, pecan ,, three varieties of burl ,, hand philippine cane ,, ceramic tiles ,, marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence ,, the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors ,, brick or paneled walls ,, windows that bring in the outdoors ..
it is a collection with a custom look ,, offering simplicity with warmth ,, variety and vitality ..


	the drexel collection ,, called composite ,, to be shown by titche's$ offers a realistic approach to decorating ,, a mature modern that is a variation of many designs ..


	rounded posts give a soft ,, sculptured look ,, paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches ,, table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia ..
a high buffet provides easy serving ,, a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end ,, recessed arched panels decorate a 60 long chest ..


	an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented ,, with a young ,, basic ,, functional group of chests ,, dressers and corner units and a canted headboard ..
the other bedroom has heavier styling ,, door dressers with acacia panels ,, a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror ..


	colorful ,, bright eastman chromspun fabrics ,, with the magenta ,, pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite ..
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles ..


	design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexel's$ fall 1961 group ,, composite ..
the spider pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony ,, to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top ..
see design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor ..
to bring warmth to the dining area ,, golden orange tones are used in the fabrics ..


	dignity and comfort ,, in a contemporary manner ,, reflecting the best aspects of today's$ design ,, with substance and maturity ,, keynote the perennian collection from heritage ..
center panel ,, hand wood ,, actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases ..
mellow bronzy fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile ..


	the vagabonds are ```` on the road '''' again ..
