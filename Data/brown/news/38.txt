	hotel escape's$ bonanza room has a real bonanza in its$ new attraction ,, the versatile ```` kings 4 ,, plus two '''' ..


	this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while  a well integrated ,, fast moving outfit specializing in skits ,, vocals ,, comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch ..


	show spotlights the kings  george worth ,, bill kay ,, frank ciciulla and gene wilson ,, flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens ..


	the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine ,, and the beat is solid ..


	in the comedy division ,, the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props ..
net result is some crazy nonsense ,, part of which can be classed as pure slapstick ..


	kings 4 ,, have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs ..
if they can't* chalk up big business here then let's+ppo stop this noise about how hip we are ,, and stick to our$ community singing ,,

	is there anything a frustrated individual can do about communism's$ growing threat on our$ doorstep and around the world ?. ?.


	more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his$ wife lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. sunday at first presbyterian church ..


	at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged ..
a young real estate salesman ,, kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force ..
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing ..


	kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism ,, but never felt there was anything he ,, as an individual ,, could do about it ..


	when he attended the christian anti crusade school here about six months ago ,, jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it ..


	the best approach ,, he figured ,, was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his$ wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church ..


	and he wanted to be careful that the kids not* only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote  a biblically strong christianity ..


	so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four program ..


	this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation ;. ;.

	until that first dedication service ,, he and lois felt their$ children were too young to take part in any religious life at home ..
they have five daughters  coral lee ,, 5 ,, glenda rae ,, 4 ,, pamela ,, 3 ,, karen ,, 2 ,, and shari ,, five months ..


	but after that service ,, they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table ,, have bedtime prayers ,, and bible stories ..
